**Introduction**

I have cleaned this list of bad websites/urls for use with my [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) (advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application). You are welcome to use it for this purpose too.

Please note that this date will not be maintained (last updated on 10 Aug 2021) but an up to date list is available in another format (see credits below).

**How to use (via GUI)**

1. Log into your Pi-hole administrator page (can be accessed at [http://pi.hole/admin/](http://pi.hole/admin/)
2. On the left side menu select **Group Management** and then navigate to **Adlists**
3. Enter this URL in the **Address** field: [https://github.com/alphanumericaltycoon/bad-hosts/blob/main/bad_hosts.txt](https://github.com/alphanumericaltycoon/bad-hosts/blob/main/bad_hosts.txt)
4. Select **Add**
5. Navigate to **Tools** > **Update Gravity** and then select **Update**
6. Done! 

**Credits**

Credit for the original list goes to **Dan Pollock** over at [someonewhocares.org](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/) who maintains an up to date list.
